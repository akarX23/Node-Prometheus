# Node-Prometheus
## Overview
#### This is a sample application which uses Prometheus to supply Metrics to a Kubernetes Cluster. I have included scripts to set up Helm, Prometheus, Grafana and Keda in a running Kubernetes Cluster.
I have included all the steps to set up everything and auto scaling in [this blog](https://medium.com/@akarX23/deploying-prometheus-and-grafana-in-a-multi-node-kubernetes-cluster-and-auto-scaling-with-keda-eccecfbd8950)
